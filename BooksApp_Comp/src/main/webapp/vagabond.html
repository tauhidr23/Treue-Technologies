        <p class="desc"> At seventeen years of age, Miyamoto Musashi--still known by his childhood name, Shinmen
          Takezō--was a wild young brute just setting out along the way of the sword. <br>
          <br>
          In the aftermath of the epic Battle of Sekigahara, Takezō finds himself a fugitive survivor on the losing side
          of the war. Takezō's vicious nature has made him an outcast even in his own village,
          and he is hunted down like an animal. At this crucial crossroads in Takezō's life, an eccentric monk and a
          childhood friend are the only ones who can help him find his way.
          About the Author: Takehiko Inoue is the creator of one of the most popular manga of all time, Slam Dunk, which
          has sold over 100 million copies worldwide. He followed that series
          up with two titles lauded by critics and fans alike--Vagabond, a fictional account of the life of Miyamoto
          Musashi, and Real, a manga about wheelchair basketball. Inoue is the recipient of numerous awards,
          including the prestigious Tezuka Osamu Culture Award and the Media Arts Festival Award. In addition to his
          work on manga, Inoue has worked on television commercials, character designs for video games, and
          is the founder of a scholarship to foster Japanese basketball talent.
